### Project Manage

- <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/lerna/lerna?style=social" height="16"> [Lerna: A tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)

  Splitting up large codebases into separate independently versioned packages is extremely useful for code sharing. However, making changes across many repositories is messy and difficult to track, and testing across repositories becomes complicated very quickly.
  
  To solve these (and many other) problems, some projects will organize their codebases into multi-package repositories (sometimes called monorepos). Projects like Babel, React, Angular, Ember, Meteor, Jest, and many others develop all of their packages within a single repository.

  Lerna is a tool that optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package repositories with git and npm.

  Lerna can also reduce the time and space requirements for numerous copies of packages in development and build environments - normally a downside of dividing a project into many separate NPM packages. See the hoist documentation for details.

  - Works everywhere. Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.
  - Battle-tested. Used in production by teams of all sizes since 2016.

### IDE

- ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/bytedance/IconPark?style=social) [CodeTour üó∫Ô∏è](https://github.com/microsoft/codetour) - CodeTour is a Visual Studio Code extension, which allows you to record and play back guided walkthroughs of your codebases. It's like a table of contents, that can make it easier to onboard (or re-board!) to a new project/feature area, visualize bug reports, or understand the context of a code review/PR change. A "code tour" is simply a series of interactive steps, each of which are associated with a specific directory, or file/line, and include a description of the respective code. This allows developers to clone a repo, and then immediately start learning it, without needing to refer to a CONTRIBUTING.md file and/or rely on help from others. Tours can either be checked into a repo, to enable sharing with other contributors, or exported to a "tour file", which allows anyone to replay the same tour, without having to clone any code to do it!
